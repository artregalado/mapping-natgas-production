# Mapping natural gas production: a tutorial on plotting maps with energy data in python

When analysing production patterns in the oil and gas industry maps are excellent tools to help in visualizing them. Therefore, it is important for energy analysts to be able to plot them and report them in their analyses. In this notebook I show how to plot a map using the programming language python. In particular, the natural gas production of September 2019 from Mexico's national oil company, PEMEX, is plotted.  

Some words of caution regarding the information presented here are due:

1. When merging the information for field production to the fields shapefile, some information can be lost because of the difference in names as well as known differences in the files from the Ministry of Energy and the National Hydrocarbons Commission. However, the focus of this tutorial is to show how to do it and not an analysis. 

2. This map should not be used for a thorough analysis of production, it is only an example to demonstrate the strength of python for data analysis.
